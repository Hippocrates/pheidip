Tracker App TODO:

- UPGRADE: Switching to a tab and back causes the entered values to be re-set to the last saved data
  - This is mostly a symptom of the ad-hoc data-binding being used, there are probably 3 solutions to this, ranging from easiest to hardest
  - I'll probably implement the easy solution for AGDQ2, and go from there.

- UPGRADE: Better Searching
  - Possily allow searches to be performed on a tab, such that you can run a search multiple times without having to re-type it
  - Allow multi-select in the list boxes to open multiple tabs: should be easy to do

- UPGRADE: Better donation task view
  - Right now, its fairly inflexible.
  - A better approach might be to associate a specific search query with it, and then let the user perform whatever as needed...
  - Even better might be to associate it in a more generic fashion
    - I.e. have a generic 'Search' interface, that templates on the Object to Search and the searching parameters
    - Then, whenever you open a task it can either auto-associate it with a pre-built query, or you can open a search in
    'results' view, which will just take an entity panel, and process it in the same way...
    - That would make processing a series of entities much easier, since it would preclude having to repeat the query
    - In the other direction, we could make searching queries persistent tabs instead, and then just open the tabs independently
      -> it should still be possible to search via dialog too...

- Upgrade/Bug: string lowercasing avoiding
  - Either figure out how to set up Mysql case-insensitive collating, or do the double string set-up
  - Priority: Low
  - Difficulty: Medium-High
  
~ UPGRADE: Make the bid searching dialog better
  - It's a little better, but it could still probably be better.
  - The forthcomming upgrades might make this a little easier to make better
  - Priority: High
  - Difficulty: Medium-High
