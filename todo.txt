Tracker App TODO:

- UPGRADE: Data access layer speed
  - fix all accesses to avoid round-trips to the server
  - Priority: Highest
  - Difficulty: Highest

- UPGRADE: Try retrieving game times (and names) from the google docs spreadsheet
  - what to do about games added removed?
  - well, I guess destroy removed games, and sync up in that fashion
  - Priority: Medium
  - Difficulty: High
  
- UPGRADE: Consistent ordering of games, prizes, bids, etc...
  - Well, once we get game start/end times, we can use joins on that for ordering those things
  - Consistent ordering of donors would be helpful too (by name)
  
- BUG: "donors with more than one word in a name have their names cut off"
  - this has to do with the string.split-ing going on
  - Probably the best bet would be to put first in first, and then rest in last name
  
- BUG: "it looked like the 'winner didn't win another prize' checkbox was gone"
  - investigate
  - Priority: High
  - Difficulty: Low
  
- Upgrade/Bug: string lowercasing avoiding
  - Either figure out how to set up Mysql case-insensitive collatting, or do the double string set-up
  - Priority: Low
  - Difficulty: Medium-High
